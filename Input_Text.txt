Here I am today. OK, so I didn't bring my Power Rangers lunchbox but, my parents are here with their camera, snapping pictures and wishing me well. My best friend James is here, and he's still a really cool kid. And, I am excited.

But this is how things are different. Twelve years ago I was excited, but I had no idea about the implications of the journey I was about to begin. I had no idea that after st grade there would be nd grade and rd grade and so on. I was just excited to be in first grade.

Today, I know that I am standing on the brink of my future - the first day of the rest of my life. As a "computer geek" I am inspired by the words of one of our greatest American computer scientists, Alan Kay. He said, "The greatest way to predict the future is to invent it."

Some of us here today, including our parents, are wondering how our lives are going to turn out. It is OK to wonder but, I also think it is important to realize that our future is not just something that happens to us. It is up to us to create.
